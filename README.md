# gap

This is a GAP-system repository for version 4. Some of the functionalities still might work with v3 but most are compatible with v4.

I have been working on Representation Theory of Finite Coxeter Groups. 
I started with the representations of finite symmetric groups and therefore most of the functions defined here are relevant to that area.
